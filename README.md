## Description
Tetris is a puzzle game with fairly simple rules. The main task in Tetris is to arrange blocks to form as many complete horizontal lines as possible. The Tetris game we are creating has multiple levels, with each level differing in the speed at which the Tetris blocks descend. When the Tetris blocks fill up the entire space, the player loses, and a score is displayed. The score is based on the number of lines cleared by the player with Tetris blocks.
